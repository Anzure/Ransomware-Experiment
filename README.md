# Ransomware-Experiment
Just a ransomware experiment for testing purposes. It's using RSA 4096-bit public key encryption that encrypts blocks of 501 bytes in order to encrypt whole files. The public encryption key is preset in the application, as you can see in the source code. The private encryption key is used for decryption, but this is not available in the source code.
Be careful and do not run, unless you are sure you want to test. It may encrypt multiple files, and you may not be able to restore the files.
