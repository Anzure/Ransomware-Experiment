# Ransomware-Experiment
Just a ransomware experiment for testing purposes. It's using RSA 4096-bit public key encryption that encrypts blocks of 501 bytes in order to encrypt whole files. The encryption key is preset in the application, as you can see in the source code. Be careful and don't run unless you are sure you want to test. It may encrypt multiple files.

Please don't redistribute this software without permission. You can contact me if you accidently encrypt something using it, at the moment I have the private key. I cannot guarantee that I will keep it. However, decryption time is really slow.
